        I am a web developer with expertise in JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, React,
        HTML, CSS, SQL, jQuery.
        I enjoy using new technologies and solve problems and create applications
        that are beautiful and efficient.
        I graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Biomedical Engineering,
        and worked for over a year in the biopharmaceutical industry.
        After working with code in both my college experience and my job,
        I realized how exciting coding was and decided to pursue it as my career.
