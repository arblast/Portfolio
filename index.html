          I am a web developer with expertise in JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, React,
          HTML, CSS, SQL, jQuery.
          I enjoy using new technologies and solve problems and create applications
          that are beautiful and efficient.
          I graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Biomedical Engineering,
          and worked for over a year in the biopharmaceutical industry.
          After working with code in both my college experience and my job,
          I realized how exciting coding was and decided to pursue it as my career.
